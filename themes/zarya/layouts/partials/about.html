                <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
                <p>I’m completely self-taught, but I didn’t do it alone. Everything I know is thanks to countless people who
                    have freely shared their knowledge with the world. They inspire me, and I want to give back, too. Everything
                    I learn, I document here. And there is always something new to learn.</p>
