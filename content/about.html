<p><strong>Front End Web Developer and Web Designer</strong> and heck Digital Marketer by way of the beautiful Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>I graduated from THE Texas State University with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice and a minor in Computer Science.  I decided to pursue a CJ and got my first gig out of College working for the County. I was so excited as I didn't know what the real adult work force was about. At first I loved it as I had been working part time retail for years in undergrad and finally felt what is was like making real money with benefits.
I ended up working there for 3 years before deciding to pursue programming. Working the typical 8-5, sitting in traffic, feeling miserable about myself in a cublicle wasn't for me. I felt like I have always wanted to create things and programming seemed very exciting to me. A co-worker and I decided on a local Community College as the best way to get our toes wet. I loved this experience but felt the learning was too slow as I was also self teaching myself at a faster rate. I did gain knowledge in important concepts and structures needed for my future and a greatful for that experience.</p>
<p>I decided to accelerate my knowledge by going to a part time Coding Bootcamp here in Austin since I already had a Bachelors and was already teaching myself. After a little research I landed on <a href="https://austincodingacademy.com/">Austin Coding Academy</a>. I went after my day job and learned important concepts such as white boarding, interview prep, and peer programming. Stuff that is essential that you can't learn by self teaching.</p>
<p>Landed my first professional Web Dev job shortly after graduation and have been here since grinding, constantly learning, and growing. Both the company and I have grown a ton and I picked up a lot of soft skills along with a better skillset. I do believe is time once again to grow so enjoy my journey!</p>
