Hey to all!  Hopefully I'm starting to generate some people to this blog. I'm making it a goal to continue to write and post helpful tips as I learn and grow as a Dev.  I've been working really hard on my Design skills. It was serisouly needed. Color Theory, Typography, the new trends etc.  

With that being said, I am starting [Wes Bos' JavaScript30](https://wesbos.com/javascript30/) course which is 30 days of straight JS with daily challenges and tuts. Love him, starting tomorrow. My boys play tonight aka the Houston Texans. Going for 8 in a row!

I'm also growing my new [Developer/Designer IG](https://www.instagram.com/creative.gabe/) account to join the amazing community that already exists. Give me a follow and a shout!
