# Welcome to my new Portfolio!

I'm excited to have built out this beautiful site from complete scratch. Literally. Started it about 5 months from this post date and chipped away at it day by day.  The main purpose is to showcase how much I have improved since I landed my first ever Front End gig full time. I will for sure post more this time, whether it be trips I go on or concerts I go to.  I also want to really start making some tutorials.

I made the move from Jekyll to [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io/) so that my site would be super fast without any hiccups that I had been having with Jekyll.  The syntax is a lot easier to grasp as well.  I also went away from hosting with GitHub Pages and moved to [Netfliy] (https://www.netlify.com/) which is way better in my opinion. Instant changes upon pushing changes. Free secure cert, and fast loading.

I also built it using better Flexbox and implemented CSS Grid.  Of course I used SASS as well. I will post my sweet build setup in a future post. Thanks for reading and thanks for visting. Like I said, hit me up and say hi. ðŸ˜Š
