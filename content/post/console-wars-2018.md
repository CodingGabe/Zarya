We are at the peak of the 'Console Wars'.  I know that term died awhile back but in my opinion it is still very much alive today as the fanboyism is very active in the respected communities. I, for one, have been super loyal to Microsoft and the Xbox since the original launced in 2001. My pops had a PS2 so I would often go over and play those exclusives. At that time it was Metal Gear, Tekken and my one of my all time favorites, Kingdom Hearts ðŸ’Ÿ . Prior to that I owned the Gamecube &amp; 64, aww the golden days. Enough of the nostalgia trip, my main point is that I am not being biased towards any brand but there was a long portion of my life where I only played Microsoft and Nintendo consoles.
